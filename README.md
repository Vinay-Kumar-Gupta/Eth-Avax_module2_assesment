# Ethereum ATM Using MetaMask Wallet And Unit Conversion Of Ether

This project demonstrates how to build an Ethereum ATM web application that interacts with the Ethereum blockchain using the MetaMask wallet extension. The application allows users to connect their MetaMask wallet, check their account balance, deposit and withdraw Ether, and perform unit conversions between different Ether units (wei, Gwei, ether, finney).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- MetaMask wallet extension installed in your browser.
- Node.js and npm installed on your system.
  
## Setup
First Clone the repo by running this command on ypu terminal
```Terminal
git clone https://github.com/Vinay-Kumar-Gupta/Eth-Avax_module2_assesment.git
```

After cloning the github, you will want to do the following to get the code running on your computer.

1. Inside the project directory, in the terminal type: npm i
2. Open two additional terminals in your VS code
3. In the second terminal type: npx hardhat node
4. In the third terminal, type: npx hardhat run --network localhost scripts/deploy.js
5. Back in the first terminal, type npm run dev to launch the front-end.

After this, the project will be running on your localhost. 
Typically at http://localhost:3000/

## Usage

1. Click the "Connect to Wallet" button to connect your MetaMask wallet.
2. Check your account balance displayed in Ether.
3. Deposit and withdraw Ether using the respective buttons.
4. Use the unit conversion buttons (wei, Gwei, finney, ether) to perform unit conversions and update your balance accordingly.

## Technologies Used

1. React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
2. ethers.js: A library for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain.
3. MetaMask: A popular Ethereum wallet extension for browsers.

## Note
Make sure you have MetaMask installed and a testnet or mainnet account with sufficient Ether for testing.
